* Introduction

I've been interested in looking at some AFL data more in depth. Both for interest, and for team and player projects. Here I show how to get the data from the AFL website.

Now let's look at the 2001 data.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :exports both :results output
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(directlabels)
  load("../data-raw/results-year-2001.rda")
  r1 <- results2001 %>% filter(round == 1)

  calcElo <- function(rndData, oldRating, K, ha = 0){
      rndData <- rndData %>%
          mutate(
              rOldHome = with(oldRating %>%
                              filter(team %in% rndData$teamNameHome,
                                     oldRating$round == rndData$round[1] - 1),
                              rating),
              rOldAway = with(oldRating %>%
                              filter(team %in% rndData$teamNameAway,
                                     oldRating$round == rndData$round[1] - 1),
                              rating),
              diffRateHome = rOldHome - rOldAway + ha,
              diffRateAway = rOldAway - rOldHome,
              expWinHome = 1/(10^(-diffRateHome/400) + 1),
              expWinAway = 1 - expWinHome,
              winHome = ifelse(pointsHome - pointsAway == 0, 0.5,
                        ifelse(pointsHome - pointsAway > 0, 1, 0)),
              winAway = 1 - winHome,
              rNewHome = rOldHome + K * (winHome - expWinHome),
              rNewAway = rOldAway + K * (winAway - expWinAway)
          )
      ## Then put back into a stacked (tidy) data frame.
      nextRating <- with(rndData,
                         data_frame(round = rep(round, 2),
                                    team = c(teamNameHome, teamNameAway),
                                    rating = c(rNewHome, rNewAway)))
      nextRating
  }

  ## Model up to end of home and away.
  ratings <- data_frame(team = unique(results2001$teamNameHome),
                        rating = 1300,
                        round = 0
                        )
  for(i in 1:22){
      rnd <- results2001 %>% filter(round == i)
      newRating <- calcElo(rnd, oldRating = ratings, K = 5)
      ratings <- bind_rows(ratings, newRating)
      message(paste0("Rated rounds 0 to ", i))
  }

  plt <- ggplot(ratings, aes(x = round, y = rating, colour = team)) +
      geom_line() +
      scale_colour_discrete(guide = "none") +
      geom_dl(aes(label = team), method = "last.bumpup")
